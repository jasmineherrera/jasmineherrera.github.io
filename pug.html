    <p><h1>PUGS</h1>
    <h4>What is a pug?</h4>
    <div>A pug is a breed of dog with a squished face and a curled tail. They are medium sized and loved by all. Also they are almost always chubby.</div>
    <h4>Why do I love pugs?</h4>
    <div>A pug's look and demeanor are unique. Also, they all have distinct personalities that separate them from other dogs. I admire how special they are. I also love how chubby and round they are. When they move, their fat makes them jiggle as they waddle around and it always puts a smile on my face. Though some find their wrinkles to be grotesque, I believe it to be adorable. Overall, pugs are cute and fun and that's what makes them my favorite.</div>
